### Hi there, My name is Jessica Maximo üëã

‚ö°I am from Bras√≠lia, but currently, I live in Montreal. I am a student in the Mobile Application Program at C√©gep de la Gasp√©sie (Montreal Campus). Currently, I am committed to improving my skills as a developer and working on some personal projects

‚ö°I love studying and am always seeking challenges and opportunities to develop myself. Because of this, I stopped my career as a physiotherapist to venture into the field of technology. Certainly, my years of previous experience have helped me to have excellent communication and problem-solving skills. 

‚ö°Here I am, open to making new connections and discovering ways to make the digital world a better place, I understand that development mobile is not just about lines of code, it's about creating experiences that resonate with users and drive business goals.This unique combination of technical knowledge and interpersonal skills enables me to collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary teams, eliminate communication barriers and deliver solutions that exceed expectations.
