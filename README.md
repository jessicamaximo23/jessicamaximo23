### Hi there, My name is Jessica Maximo üëã

I am from Bras√≠lia, but currently, I live in Montreal. I am 30 years old and a student in the Mobile Application Program at C√©gep de la Gasp√©sie (Montreal Campus).

Currently, I am committed to improving my skills as a developer and working on some personal projects using the Kotlin language. I love studying and am always seeking challenges and opportunities to develop myself. Because of this, I stopped my career as a physiotherapist to venture into the field of technology. Certainly, my years of previous experience have helped me to have excellent communication and problem-solving skills.

Here I am, open to making new connections and discovering ways to make the digital world a better place.‚ö°
